GPT Language Model Implementation with PyTorch
==============================================

This project is a PyTorch implementation of a GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model. It trains on a text dataset and generates new text based on learned patterns.

Features
--------

*   Transformer-based language model using multi-head self-attention.
    
*   Configurable hyperparameters for easy experimentation.
    
*   Trains on any text dataset provided.
    
*   Generates text after training.
    

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
    
*   PyTorch
    
*   CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)
    

Installation
------------

1.  bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.gitcd your-repo-name
    
2.  bashCopy codepip install torchMake sure you have PyTorch installed with CUDA support if you plan to use a GPU.
    

Usage
-----

### Prepare Your Dataset

*   Place your training text data in a file named data.txt in the project directory.
    

### Training the Model

*   bashCopy codepython train.pyThe script will start training the model using the dataset provided.
    

### Generating Text

*   pythonCopy codecontext = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)print(decode(model.generate(context, max\_new\_tokens=500)\[0\].tolist()))You can adjust max\_new\_tokens to control the length of the generated text.
    

Hyperparameters
---------------

You can adjust the hyperparameters at the beginning of the script to experiment with different settings:

*   batch\_size: Number of sequences processed in parallel.
    
*   block\_size: Maximum context length for predictions.
    
*   max\_iters: Total number of training iterations.
    
*   eval\_interval: Interval for evaluating on validation set.
    
*   learning\_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.
    
*   n\_embd: Embedding dimension.
    
*   n\_head: Number of attention heads.
    
*   n\_layer: Number of Transformer blocks.
    
*   dropout: Dropout rate for regularization.
    

Code Overview
-------------

*   **Data Preparation**: Reads text data and creates character-level encodings.
    
*   **Model Architecture**:
    
    *   Head: Implements one head of self-attention.
        
    *   MultiHeadAttention: Combines multiple attention heads.
        
    *   FeedForward: Simple feed-forward neural network.
        
    *   Block: Combines attention and feed-forward layers with residual connections.
        
    *   GPTLanguageModel: Puts everything together into a full model.
        
*   **Training Loop**: Handles batching, loss computation, backpropagation, and optimization.
    
*   **Text Generation**: Uses the trained model to generate new text sequences.
    

Example Output
--------------

After training, the model may generate text like:
